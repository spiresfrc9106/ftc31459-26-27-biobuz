/**
 * L5: holonomic drive. Now the robot can strafe.
 *
 * <p>Arcade used two numbers, forward and turn, and both sides of the robot did
 * the same thing. Mecanum wheels can do a third: slide sideways without turning.
 * That needs all four wheels mixed separately, which is what
 * {@link L5HolonomicDriveTrain#sticks} does.
 *
 * <p>The left stick now does two jobs at once -- push it to drive, push it
 * sideways to slide -- and the right stick still turns. Everything is relative
 * to the robot's own front: push the stick left and the robot slides towards its
 * own left, whichever way it happens to be facing. Making it slide towards the
 * driver's left instead comes in L11.
 *
 * <p>Passes when: LessonsTest.l5_holonomicCanStrafe
