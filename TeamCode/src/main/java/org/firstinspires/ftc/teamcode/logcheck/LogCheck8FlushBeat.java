/**
 * Check 8: make the logger's storage writes visible, on purpose, at 3 Hz.
 *
 * <p>An earlier run showed the loop time carrying a strong 3.94 Hz impulse train
 * -- one brief cost every 254 ms, with harmonics out to 35 Hz -- while the
 * logger's own once-a-second flush sat at 9.7 microseconds, barely above the
 * noise floor. 254 ms is almost certainly the Driver Station telemetry
 * transmission, not us.
 *
 * <p>This OpMode settles it by writing a known amount of data per second, so the
 * 64 KB buffer fills exactly three times a second. If a 3 Hz line (and its
 * harmonics at 6, 9, 12 Hz) appears in the loop-time spectrum, storage writes
 * are visible in loop time and we know what they cost. If it does not, they are
 * below the noise even at that rate, and nothing about how we batch writes could
 * matter.
 *
 * <p>Three things make the signal clean:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@code endLoop()} is deliberately NOT called. Its one-second flush would
 *       interleave with the buffer fills and smear the beat -- measured at 3.95
 *       Hz with it on, a clean 3.05 Hz with it off.</li>
 *   <li>The Driver Station transmission interval is moved to 200 ms, putting the
 *       SDK's comb at 5, 10, 15 Hz and away from ours at 3, 6, 9, 12.</li>
 *   <li>Each block's contents change, so change-only writing cannot skip
 *       them.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p><b>This writes about 200 KB every second</b> -- roughly 4 MB in twenty
 * seconds. Run it briefly, and delete the files afterwards.
 *
 * <p>Afterwards, run an FFT of {@code /loop/ms} against time and look for a line
 * at 3 Hz with harmonics.
