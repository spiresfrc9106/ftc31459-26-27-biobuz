/**
 * Turns a command for the whole robot into a target for each wheel.
 *
 * <p>Everything here is in inches per second, and radians per second for the
 * turn. A mecanum robot moving forward at {@code f}, towards its own left at
 * {@code s} and turning counter-clockwise at {@code omega} needs its wheels to
 * travel at
 *
 * <pre>
 *   front left  = f - s - omega * radius
 *   front right = f + s + omega * radius
 *   back left   = f + s - omega * radius
 *   back right  = f - s + omega * radius
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Those are Pedro's four lines, and the directions are Pedro's too; see
 * {@link CorbelsDriveTrain}.
 *
 * where {@code radius} is half the sum of the track width and the wheelbase --
 * how far a wheel is from the middle, along the diagonal it pushes.
 *
 * <p>Note what this is not: a power. Nothing here has been divided by a maximum
 * or clamped to 1. These are speeds the wheels should actually travel at, and
 * turning them into motor power is a separate job.
