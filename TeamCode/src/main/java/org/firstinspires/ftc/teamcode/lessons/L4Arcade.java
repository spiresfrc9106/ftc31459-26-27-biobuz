/**
 * L4: arcade drive. One stick drives, the other turns. Still no strafing.
 *
 * <p>The left stick says how fast to go. The right stick, pushed sideways, says
 * how fast to spin. {@link L4ArcadeDriveTrain#sticks} works out the four wheel
 * powers.
 *
 * <p>Pushing the right stick to the right should turn the robot to the right,
 * and turning to the right is <i>clockwise</i>. The drivetrain counts a turn as
 * positive when it is counter-clockwise, so the stick gets a minus sign. Every
 * turn number in this code is counter-clockwise-positive from here on, which is
 * also how the path follower counts.
 *
 * <p>Passes when: LessonsTest.l4_arcadeUsesOneStickToDriveAndOneToTurn
