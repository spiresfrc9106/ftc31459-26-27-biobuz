/**
 * Shared Panels logging for the Corbels OpModes.
 *
 * <p><b>How Panels 1.0 graphs.</b> There is no graph() method. The Graph panel
 * parses telemetry text: any line containing {@code name: number} becomes a
 * plottable series. {@code addData(k, v)} writes exactly that format, so every
 * addData value appears in the Panels text panel AND the graph picker. Names
 * may contain anything except a colon.
 *
 * <p>A series appears in the picker only after it has been sent once, in the
 * order it was first sent. The picker is a flat list; the {@code loop/},
 * {@code pose/} and {@code vel/} prefixes are for readability only.
 *
 * <p><b>Sampling.</b> The robot sends to Panels every 75 ms by default and
 * discards lines from the loops in between, so graphs are sampled, not
 * per-loop. With a ~5 ms loop, roughly 1 loop in 15 reaches the graph.
 * {@code loop/max_ms} exists to catch spikes that sampling misses.
 * {@code panels.setUpdateInterval(ms)} lowers the interval at the cost of
 * more Wi-Fi traffic.
 *
 * <p><b>Panels only.</b> Everything here goes to Panels and nowhere else.
 * ({@code TelemetryManager.update(telemetry)} would copy every Panels line to
 * the Driver Station, which crowds its screen.) The Driver Station belongs to
 * {@link Tracker#printToDs}, which also owns the loop count and the loop
 * timing.
 *
 * <p><b>Field view.</b> Draws on the Panels Field panel, in this order:
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Path</b> (orange) -- the segment being followed, if any.</li>
 *   <li><b>Trail</b> (grey) -- where the robot has been since start().</li>
 *   <li><b>Aim point</b> (green square) -- {@code closestPose()}: the nearest
 *       point on the path, at the heading the path wants there. The gap to the
 *       robot is the tracking error. Only drawn while following or holding.</li>
 *   <li><b>Robot</b> (blue square, 18 x 18 in) with a heading line.</li>
 * </ol>
 * This is the Pedro 3 equivalent of Pedro 2's {@code Drawing.drawDebug()},
 * which no longer exists. The PEDRO_PATHING preset maps Pedro coordinates
 * (0..144 in, origin in a field corner) onto the field image, so poses go in
 * unconverted.
