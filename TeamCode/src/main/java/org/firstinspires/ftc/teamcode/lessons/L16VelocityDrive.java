/**
 * L16: drive in real units.
 *
 * <p>Until now a stick has meant "power": push it half way and the motor gets
 * 0.5, whatever that turns out to be. The robot goes slower on a full battery
 * at the end of a match, slower again up a ramp, and faster on blocks with its
 * wheels off the ground. Nothing in the code knows how fast the robot is going.
 *
 * <p>Here a stick means a <b>speed</b>. Full forward asks for
 * {@link Constants#maxWheelInchesPerSecond} inches per second, and the robot
 * goes that fast whether the battery is full or flat -- because the code
 * measures what the wheels are doing and corrects.
 *
 * <p>Two parts to that, and both are in {@link #loop}:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Feedforward</b> -- a guess at the power needed for a wanted speed,
 *       from the fact that power and speed are roughly proportional. Gets most
 *       of the way there immediately.</li>
 *   <li><b>Feedback</b> -- a correction proportional to the error between the
 *       speed asked for and the speed measured. Cleans up what the guess got
 *       wrong: battery, friction, carpet, a ramp.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>Feedforward alone is always a little off. Feedback alone has to build up
 * error before it does anything, so it lags. Together they are how nearly every
 * velocity controller works.
 *
 * <p>Passes when: LessonsTest.l16_theSticksCommandASpeedAndTheWheelsAreCorrectedTowardsIt,
 * LessonsTest.l16_whenTheWheelsAreUpToSpeedOnlyTheFeedforwardRemains and
 * LessonsTest.l16_turningAskesEachSideForOppositeSpeeds
