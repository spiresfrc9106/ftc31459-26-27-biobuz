/**
 * Measures what the Control Hub's battery reading is actually worth: how long it
 * costs to read, how often it changes, how finely it resolves, and how fast it
 * follows a real load.
 *
 * <p>Worth measuring because the SDK source settles less than you would hope.
 * {@code LynxVoltageSensor.getVoltage()} sends one ADC command to the hub and
 * returns the reply in millivolts -- no smoothing, no history, no caching, and
 * notably <b>not part of the bulk read</b>, so every call is its own round trip.
 * Whether the hub's own firmware or its analogue front end filters the signal is
 * not published anywhere, and claims about it online trace back to a different
 * vendor's motor controller. So: measure.
 *
 * <p><b>Put the robot on blocks.</b> The wheels spin freely and the test drives
 * them in square waves; on the floor it would drive off.
 *
 * <p>Hold the right trigger. The test steps through its phases by itself and
 * stops at the end. Download the log afterwards.
 *
 * <table>
 *   <tr><td>phase 0</td><td>idle, 3 s</td><td>resolution and call cost with no load</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>1 to 5</td><td>square wave at 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 Hz</td><td>how far the reading swings as the load gets faster</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>What the numbers mean afterwards:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>call_us</b> -- what one reading costs. If it is large, read it less
 *       often than every loop.</li>
 *   <li><b>volts</b> at idle -- the distinct values it takes are its resolution,
 *       and how often it changes is its update rate.</li>
 *   <li><b>swing per frequency</b> -- the amplitude of the voltage wobble
 *       against drive frequency. Where it falls to about 70% of the 1 Hz value
 *       is the corner frequency of whatever filtering exists, hardware or
 *       firmware. If it barely falls by 20 Hz, there is little filtering and the
 *       reading can be trusted per loop.</li>
 * </ul>
