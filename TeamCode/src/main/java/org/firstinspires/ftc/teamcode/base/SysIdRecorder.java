 * Writes the channels WPILib's SysId analyser reads.

 * the commanded power times whatever the battery is giving at that moment --
 * which means battery sag appears as fewer volts for the same power, rather than
 * as noise in the fit.
 *
 * <p>The analyser asks the user which channels to use, so the names here need
 * not match WPILib's exactly; the {@link State} values do have to, because it
 * splits them on the last dash and refuses anything else.
